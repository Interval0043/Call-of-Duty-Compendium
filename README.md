# Call-of-Duty-Compendium
I'm tired of trackers not going back past Modern Warfare (2019) in most cases. Let's change that.

I'm a Call of Duty player, having seen merit in nearly all games. Each and every one has weapon challenges that are harder to track, and one centralized program to do it all would be fairly nice. This is an exercise in my amateur knowledge, data storage, Avalonia, and otherwise necessary components.

This was developed on multiple different computers, all of which run some variation of Ubuntu. As far as I'm aware, this could work on Windows, but I haven't tested it yet. What I want is for this to be cross-platform across the big 3, and then maybe an Android release if I ever get that far.
